### Summary:

I plan to master front-end development technologies at a high level and build a career in this area. Now I have the opportunity and desire to do programming 40-60 hours a week.

In 2012 I graduated from Belarusian State University, Faculty of Liberal Education (now “Faculty of Social and Cultural Communications”) with a qualification of “Programmer”, specializing in “Web-design”. In 2016 I graduated from Belarus State Economic University, Professional Development in Economics Institution, with the qualification of “Economist-manager”.

Currently looking for a opportunity to join a dynamic, ambitious, growing company.

I love to study. I quickly master new technologies and large amounts of information myself. I possess highly motivation, self-discipline and the ability to work with the minimum of supervision.

Inquisitive and responsible, like communicate clearly and effectively, analytical mindset, abstract thinking, fantasy and ingenuity.

For me, qualified colleagues, a friendly team and the opportunity for professional and career development are important.

### English

Pre-Intermediate (A2)

I started learning English from the 6th grade at school. I studied technical English at the university to the level Intermediate. 
Unfortunately, without practice, my level of English declined.

Now I am actively restoring the level of language. I attend courses at MSLU, use LinguaLeo and PuzzleEnglish, watch video tutorials on YouTube and read web development materials.
